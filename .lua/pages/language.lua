        <h2>What's the lowdown on Lua?</h2>
        <p>
            Why did I use Lua for this site instead of something more popular? <span style="font-weight: 300">It's fun.</span> That's it really, I just appreciate the language. 
            I've made web apps with JavaScript and Python, one day I'd like to do something with Ruby, those are great too, but Lua just feels DIY and 
            perfect for a hobby site.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you aren't familiar with Lua, I'd recommend stopping by <a class="plinks" href="lua.org">Lua.org</a> to get the real lowdown, as this article
            is just the opinion of a very big brained and charmingly modest self-taught coder (also some would say good looking... hey, I said <em>some!</em>)
        </p>

        <p>
            Lua was the first language I learned outside of shell scripting. It's a great first language for an autodidact, it's syntax is really intuitive. Often
            this is the justification to recommend Python to beginners, but Python has a huge standard library, which I would argue is actually detrimental to
            learning. The more code you must write yourself, the more you have to actually understand.
        </p>

        <p>In no particular order, here are some reasons I'm a lifelong Lua fan:</p>
        <ul class="plist">
        <li>It's tiny at ~500kb with the full standard library</li>
        <li>It's portable. No complicated environment configs</li>
        <li>Widely used for hobby coding, notably embedded/robotics type stuff and videogames</li>
        <li>Designed as a C scripting/embedded language, so there's a clear learning path to lower level systems programming</li>
        <li>Great community, if comparatively small</li>
        <li>Punches above its weight class in terms of performance</li>
        <li>You can define a function's environment, making security a breeze</li>
        <li>Monkey-patching is simple, and nobody is judgey about it</li>
        <li>You haven't truly lived until you've experienced the joy of metamethods and metatables</li>
        <li>Its creator, Roberto Ierusalimschy, is a great teacher and <em>Programming In Lua</em> is very well written.</li>
        <li>Not many people have heard about it, so you get to tell all your friends about something cool!</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Again, this isn't a criticism of other languages, they definitely have their strengths as well. And there are, of course, disadvantages to using Lua.
            The libraries are pretty sparse, and if you use Windows, you're probably going to have a bad time compiling them. Lua doesn't run in the browser, so
            you'll have to use JavaScript and/or Emscripten if you want to do animations and games. It doesn't open many doors for employment, as it's most
            often only used professionally in the gaming industry, and as a secondary language for Electrical Engineering. And even though I picked on Python a bit,
            sometimes you really just aren't in the mood to write your own libraries.
        </p>

            One final thought to consider: Lua may never be number one on the Tiobe Index. It may not go into outer space, like 
            <a class="plinks" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23206110/james-webb-space-telescope-javascript-jwst-instrument-control">JavaScript did</a>,
            or capture the imagination of poets, <a class="plinks" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">like Python</a>. But that's okay. Check out any Lua board 
            and just see how many young people are learning Lua right now. Because of Roblox, Pico-8, World of Warcraft, eLua, Mako Server, and many other neat things,
            an entire generation of future coders are cutting their teeth with Lua, and learning to love learning. Lua's going to be around for a long time. So 
            technical details aside, maybe consider Lua for your next project because... <span style="font-weight: 300">It's fun!</span>
